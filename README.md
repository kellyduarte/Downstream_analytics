## Genetic Sequencing Analysis with R
# Overview

This repository contains scripts and code snippets designed to assist in the analysis of genetic sequencing data. In the process of genetic sequencing analysis, the final output often involves graphical representations that facilitate data interpretation. Understanding how to explore data through downstream analyses is crucial in extracting meaningful insights.

# Contents
This repository includes code snippets written in R, a powerful programming language for statistical computing and data visualization. R provides a wide range of packages that enable data manipulation and visualization, making it a valuable tool in genomics research.

# How to Use
Feel free to explore the provided code snippets to enhance your understanding of genetic sequencing data analysis using R. These scripts are the result of the "Bioinformatics for Biologists: Analyzing and Interpreting Genomics Datasets" course offered by Wellcome Connecting Science.

# Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have R and RStudio installed on your machine. If not, you can download them from R Project and RStudio.

# Dependencies
Make sure you have the necessary R packages installed before running the scripts. You can install the required packages using the following commands:

```markdown
# Example installation of required packages
